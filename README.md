# 🌧️ Hydrology Unit Hydrograph Automation (Google Colab Ready)

This repository contains an automated Python tool to generate a **1-inch Unit Hydrograph** directly from rainfall–discharge data.  
It replicates hydrology lab workflows — computing rainfall excess, direct runoff, and plotting both **Unit Hydrograph** and **Total Hydrograph** automatically.

## Features
✅ Accepts simple CSV input (Time, Rainfall, Discharge)  
✅ Calculates rainfall excess, direct runoff, and net rainfall  
✅ Derives 1-inch Unit Hydrograph  
✅ Plots both Unit and Total Hydrographs  
✅ Saves computed results automatically as CSV
